*Overview*

This project is a modular backtesting framework for trading strategies, allowing you to fetch historical market data, compute technical indicators, generate entry/exit signals, optimize parameters, manage risk, run simulations, and visualize performance results. It’s designed to be extensible and maintainable, enabling you to easily experiment with different strategies and parameters.

*Project Structure*

1. **Data Fetching & Preprocessing (data.py)**:
    - **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Uses the `ccxt` library with async support to retrieve historical OHLCV data from cryptocurrency exchanges.
    - **Caching:** Stores fetched data locally for faster subsequent runs.
    - **Preprocessing & Validation:** Cleans and validates data (removing duplicates, handling missing values, setting proper indices) to ensure the integrity of the input before it’s used by the strategy.

2. **Indicators & Conditions (indicators.py & conditions.py)**:
    - **Indicators:** A suite of commonly used (and easily extendable) technical indicators like moving averages, oscillators, and volatility measures. The framework is flexible; you can add or modify indicators as needed without altering the core logic.
    - **Conditions:** Encapsulates logic for detecting crossovers, thresholds, and overbought/oversold levels. These condition checks serve as building blocks for formulating complex strategy signals and can be easily extended with new conditions.

3. **Strategy Definition (strategy.py)**:
    - **StrategyBase Class:** A blueprint for defining custom trading strategies.
    - **Concrete Strategies:** Implement strategies using any combination of indicators, multi-timeframe confirmations, and conditions. Define entry and exit rules, adapt parameters, and incorporate advanced features like ATR-based stop-losses and take-profits.

4. **Risk Management (rmm.py)**:
    - **Position Sizing & Risk Controls:** Determines position size based on account balance and fixed or dynamic (e.g., ATR-based) rules.
    - **Stop-Loss / Take-Profit / Trailing Stops:** Flexible exit rules to limit losses and secure profits as trades progress.

5. **Backtesting Engine (backtester.py)**:
    - **Simulation of Trades:** Runs through historical data, executes the strategy’s signals, and simulates trades accounting for slippage and commissions.
    - **Performance Tracking:** Records every trade, updates the equity curve, and computes performance metrics such as total return, win rate, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown.
    - **Modular Workflow:** By separating data, strategy, and execution logic, you can easily swap out strategies or parameters without changing the core engine.

6. **Optimization (optimizer.py)**:
    - **Grid Search & Parallel Execution:** Tests multiple parameter combinations in parallel, evaluating performance metrics to identify optimal configurations.
    - **Flexible Metrics:** Choose from various performance metrics (e.g., total return, Sharpe ratio) to guide parameter tuning.

7. **Visualization (graphs.py)**:
    - **Interactive Charts:** Uses Plotly to display price action with trade signals and equity curves.
    - **Combined Views:** Visualize both the asset’s price and the strategy’s equity side-by-side for deeper insight into trading decisions and outcomes.

8. **Main Execution Script (main.py)**:
    - **Integration Point:** Demonstrates how to fetch and preprocess data, initialize strategies, set up risk management, run backtests, optimize parameters, and generate visualizations.
    - **Example Workflow:** A starting point to understand the sequence of operations, customizable for your use case.

*Getting Started*
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and required packages (e.g., `ccxt`, `pandas`, `plotly`) installed.
2. **Fetch Data:** Configure the exchange, trading pair, timeframes, and date ranges. Run the script to fetch and cache data asynchronously.
3. **Set Strategy Parameters:** Adjust or create strategies, indicators, and conditions.
4. **Run Backtests:** Use the Backtester to simulate trades, measure performance, and refine your approach.
5. **Optimize Parameters:** Employ the GridSearchOptimizer to find parameter sets that maximize your chosen performance metrics.
6. **Visualize Results:** View price charts, trade markers, and equity curves to gain insights into strategy behavior.

*Notes*:
- The code is designed for extensibility. Add new indicators, strategies, or risk management rules without altering the core structure.
- Adjust parameters, fees, slippage, and execution rules to suit your trading environment.
- This framework bridges historical analysis to more advanced strategy development and refinement.
